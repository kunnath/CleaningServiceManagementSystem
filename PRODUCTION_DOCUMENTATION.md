### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following key tables:

#### Users Table (Admin Access)
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    password_hash TEXT,
    role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'employee')),
    email TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Customers Table (Unified Customer Data)
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    registration_source TEXT DEFAULT 'admin',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);
```

#### Customer Users Table (Portal Login)
```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Jobs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    employee_id INTEGER,
    service_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL,
    scheduled_time TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration_hours INTEGER DEFAULT 2,
    hourly_rate REAL DEFAULT 25.0,
    total_amount REAL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees (id)
);
```
